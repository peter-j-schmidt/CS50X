Welcome! This is my personal webpage, where you can learn a little about me and the projects I work on. I built this site for CS50's Web Programming Project 0: Homepage.

The first page, index.html, contains an image of me and a short bio. In the bio there is a link to the programming page, where I list the courses I have taken or am in the process of taking to learn computer science. I used Bootstrap's Card component for this page, and each page has a button that links to certificates and any final projects involved in the course.

The next page is the projects page, where I will list all personal and proffesional projects, both involving computer science and my other hobbies. This also uses the Bootstrap Card component.

Following these two pages come the CV and Favorites pages. The CV page displays a timeline of my education, professional positions, and other accomplishments. The Favorites page includes a list of my favorite websites, in topics such as Programming, Aviation, and Music. I used Bootstrap's nav tabs and Bootstrap's built in table components for this page.

All of these pages can be navigated between using the Bootstrap navbar at the top of the page. Clicking on my name takes you to index.html, and all other links take you to their prospective pages. I also have included links to my proffessional Linkedin, Twitter, Github, and Youtube accounts.

Enjoy!
